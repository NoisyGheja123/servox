# Welcome to Opsani ServoX

This site provides everything that you need to get started with cloud native
optimization. ServoX is a client component that connects your application with
the Opsani optimization engine to reduce costs and enhance performance by leveraging machine learning models to identify the most effective settings that
support your objectives.

ServoX is both an operational tool that can be directly deployed to begin 
optimization and a framework that supports the development of connectors that 
extend the reach of the optimization engine to new environments and platforms.
The documentation is organized into operational and development sections to 
support these objectives. If you are deploying ServoX to optimize your apps and
services it is not necessary to consume the development focused content.
