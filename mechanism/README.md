# Mechanism

Mechanism provides testing support for Opsani ServoX components. It provides
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) markers, fixtures, assertions, and
various other bits of functionality to enable a high-velocity, test-driven,
development workflow.

Mechanism was extracted from the ServoX test suite to make the same testing
infrastructure used by the core framework available to all connectors.
